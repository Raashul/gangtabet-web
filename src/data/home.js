		'Hashmasks introduces a combination of digital art and collectibles with a value hierarchy determined by both the creator and the consumer of the artwork. Unlike other collectibles, where the rarity of all traits is set out by the creators, Hashmasks have included two layers of scarcity: It provides a set of traits to provide general guidance to the consumer, but it has also created many implicit traits not accounted for. Above all, the control over the rarest of all traits – the name – is given to the full extent to the consumer.',

		'Naming is commoditized via the Name Changing Token (NCT), which can be interchanged with other participants of the artwork. Each name is unique and can only belong to one NFT. Hashmasks is the first collectible where the value and rarity of each piece within the collection is not predetermined, but will change and adapt over many years before it takes its final form when the last NCT is burnt.

		'Each day, 10 Name Changing Tokens (NCTs) are accumulated by each Hashmask and can be claimed by the current holder. When you have 1,830 NCTs (about ½ years worth of NCTs), you can burn these tokens and change the name of your Hashmask on-chain. The smart contracts require each name to be unique, thus, creating a second layer of scarcity within the artwork. After exactly 10 years, on 26 January 2031 (Timestamp: 1927206000), the last NCT will be emitted and from then on, the supply will only decrease until one day, the last NCT token is burnt and the art piece is complete.',
